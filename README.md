Recent upstream attacks on open source software have highlighted the need to keep code bases small enough to be grokked entirely by a single human brain.

`php-ai-starter` sets out to test the below assertions:

1. You don't need to learn python to integrate Large Language Models (LLM) and generative AI deeply into your projects!
   
2. You can enjoy the benefits of integrating LLMs and other models seamlessly into a framework-free PHP project with no reliance on millions of lines of OPC (other people's code) in the form of upstream python libraries.

Feel free to send PRs or fork and join in!
