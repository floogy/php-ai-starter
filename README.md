# A tiny module for tight integration of LLM and generative AI capabilities into your PHP project

`php-ai-starter` sets out to prove the below assertions:

1. You don't need to learn python to integrate Large Language Models (LLM) and generative AI deeply into your projects
   
2. You can enjoy the benefits of LLMs and gnerative AI without importing thousands of lines of OPC (other people's code) in the form of upstream python libraries.

Recent upstream attacks on open source software have highlighted the need to keep code bases small enough to be grokked entirely by a single human brain.

Yet, the ecosystem around tapping into LLMs and generative AI models is heavily skewed toward widely shared python libraries. This opens an attack vector as millions of code bases become vulnerable to upstream attaacks on dependencies.
